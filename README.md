# Overview

Portfolio:
This is a webapp created to hold information about me, my projects and other information I have added. This is a single page webapp, the links on the navbar should take you to the different sections of the webpage. To run this app you will have to first intall all the packages I used with `npm install` and then you can run the app with `npm run star`.

The idea to write this app was to have a way to show my work online, I was able to customize it as much as I wanted and I am happy with the result. I hope you enjoy it!

This website is also hosted online for you to see, you can visit it [here](https://projects-oscar.netlify.app/).

# Web Pages

This is a SPA. Which mean all the content is in one single page, the navbar should help you get to the different parts of the web app.

# Development Environment

To create this web app I used `VS code as my editor`. `JavaScript` as my programing lenguage and `React` as my framework library to build the UI and also `Node.js`. I also used some `HTML` to create the base webpage and `CSS` to style it.
